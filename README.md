This is a failed abandoned project and a successfully completed project.

It had two goals
1) Teach me about app development on AWS
2) Be a kick ass note taking app

# Failed Project

Note taking apps are well trodden and i don't think this brings much in terms of innovation. Also, it wasn't used much (not even by me)

# Successful Project

I messed around with AWS and built a lot of great func. It's got a really nice example for an API for AWS SAM which I plan on reusing cause it was actually very nice to work with. also got to mess around with vite and cypress, which are now my mainstays

# Doing better 

I think the goals were too seperate from each other. My next project will be more focussed on what it needs to be
